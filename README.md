### Hi im cz


### things im into

- 2b2t, a really toxic minecraft server
- overwatch, cant really do much coding with that 
- finding bugs in shit

### things ive made
- PAC and PAC 2.0 (nodejs, socketio, vuejs), stands for peabian admin console which was a program made to interface with the now defuncted server peabian which I was a developer on. (lost source to 2.0 but really old 1.0 is on my github).
- Weirdbrowsergame2 (nodejs, socketio), a game made by me as a challange of not having any internet and only having the modules already downloaded on my computer.
- alot of other stuff I dont have access to or remember after my computer died.

### what im working on
- skynet (nodejs, node-minecraft-protocol, kotlin, java, forge), a project writen in nodejs, java and kotlin that is intended to be a completely automated baritone, highwaytools and base finding bot. This is semi private as it is being funded by shulkerroad. Older versions are open sourced but the current is not because I removed the code from 2b2w which was under the gnu 3.0 licnese(sorry i just gotta cover my ass after shulkerroad is actually paying money). This project is in two parts, skynet-proxy and skynet-client, it is ment to be modular so it can be ran on multiple vpses, pcs or docker containers. skynet-proxy is written in nodejs and as the name implies is a proxy betwen 2b2t and skynet-client instances, skynet-proxy is simuler to ttrms but is ment to be used with many accounts at once (ive gotten more then 100 accounts running concurrently) with so many accounts its way easier to not buy prio on any of the accounts, it makes it so we always have  account on the server. skynet-client is written in kotlin and java, it is split into many parts, one is a [modified version of kami](https://github.com/czho/kamiblue-hwt-headless) with all rendering and lwjgl functionality removed, the other parts are a modified version of headlessforge, and skynet-client forgemod, and a wrapper that scans skynet-proxy for when ever an account is ready and then lanches the headless minecraft instance.

- czhack (java, forge 1.12), a private forge 1.12.2 client made by me mostly to add personal modules and shit.
### languages i can do shit in
- java
- nodejs
- c#

## shit im learning
- c++/c
- kotlin
- python
