### things ive made
- PAC and PAC 2.0 (nodejs, socketio, vuejs), stands for peabian admin console which was a program made to interface with the now defuncted server peabian which I was a developer on. (lost source to 2.0 but really old 1.0 is on my github).
- Weirdbrowsergame2 (nodejs, socketio) a game made by me as a challange of not having any internet and only having the modules already downloaded on my computer.

### what im working on
- skynet (nodejs, node-minecraft-protocal), a project writen in nodejs that is intended for alot of stuff but is basicly a weird way of botting shit. This is semi privite as it is being funded by shulkerroad, older versions are open sourced the rest is not because I removed the open source code.
