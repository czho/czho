### Hi im cz


### things im into

- 2b2t, a really toxic minecraft server
- overwatch, cant really do much coding with that 
- finding bugs in shit

### things ive made
- PAC and PAC 2.0 (nodejs, socketio, vuejs), stands for peabian admin console which was a program made to interface with the now defuncted server peabian which I was a developer on. (lost source to 2.0 but really old 1.0 is on my github).
- Weirdbrowsergame2 (nodejs, socketio), a game made by me as a challange of not having any internet and only having the modules already downloaded on my computer.
- alot of other stuff I dont have access to or remember after my computer died.

### what im working on
- skynet (nodejs, node-minecraft-protocol), a project writen in nodejs that is intended for alot of stuff but is basicly a weird way of botting shit. This is semi private as it is being funded by shulkerroad. Older versions are open sourced but the current is not because I removed the code from 2b2w which was under the gnu 3.0 licnese(sorry i just gotta cover my ass after shulkerroad is actually paying money).
- czhack (java, forge 1.12), a private forge 1.12.2 client made by me mostly to add personal modules and shit.
### languages i can do shit in
- java
- nodejs
- c#

## shit im learning
- c++/c
- kotlin
- python
